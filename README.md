bokeh-stats
===========

Profiling GitHub members who have starred ContinuumIO/bokeh.

These data were downloaded thanks to Jeremy Singer-Vine's [astronomer](https://github.com/jsvine/astronomer), a really nifty tool.

I encourage you to peer into other repositories; there are some interesting stargazers out there.
