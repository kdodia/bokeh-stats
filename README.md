bokeh-stats
===========

Profiling GitHub members who have starred [ContinuumIO/bokeh](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh). You can run the notebook on Wakari [here](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/kpsfire/bokeh-stats); please note this is still an early example.

These data were downloaded thanks to Jeremy Singer-Vine's [astronomer](https://github.com/jsvine/astronomer), a really nifty tool.

I encourage you to peer into other repositories; there are some interesting stargazers out there.
