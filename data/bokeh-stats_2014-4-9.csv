I also have a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from the Delhi College of Engineering. I believe my extensive education helped me with sharpening my analytical skills as well as give me confidence to handle complex tools and presenting the results and delivery to a wide sector of global clients.

Having worked with dealer management inventory and optimization for both Indian and American automakers, I have also worked on projects with financial services marketing for cross selling portfolio products to retail consumers across the globe. I started work with analytics more than seven years ago while it was still a nascent sector and profession within India. Based on my track record, I moved rapidly from my basic training at General Electric to help startup and ISO certify the Gurgaon Analytics practise of WNS prior to its initial public offering. Working with Citigroup’s India retail operations helped me develop actionable insights in actual executing of data analytics across the demand chain.

My most recent role had been a consultant for my own firm Decisionstats.com in which I handled clients ranging from a prominent French software company, a global entertainment starting up in India, web analytics and content generation for online media and supply chain optimization for a large manufacturing setup across North America. During this process I used and trained extensively in analytical tools like JMP, SAS, SPSS, R, KXEN, and helped execute the results in consultation with various stake holders across levels of management. I was invited to the Data Mining 2009 conference in Las Vegas as a guest of SAS Institute, the world’s biggest analytics company and to the Big Data Summit in New York on behalf of Aster Data.

Overall, I have worked and interacted with some of the best users as well as practitioners of analytics in the world and I hope to continue the journey with continuing results.",Ajay,Http://decisionstats.wordpress.com,ohri2007@gmail.com,decisionstats,Decisionstats.com,False,Internet,6,17,2009-12-06T00:55:06Z,2014-02-06T04:01:26Z,8cead2a489c074b6ffd297a9a8c85e5b,14,2

143435,"# My hobbies are what put bread on the table, and my degree is my hobby.

I went to school to study Philosophy - and graduated with a B. A. in that subject. A month after graduation I took a job in web development.

## Highlights

* I enjoy building software that saves people time. (Watching someone do a task in five minutes that used to take them two hours makes my day.)
* I can work with legacy code (My first impulse is ""improve"", not ""remove"").
* I enjoy working with Python, but am a polyglot by trade.

Mitchell has since moved from a niche field in structural bioinformatics to the exciting realm of sequence bioinformatics. At present, he’s the groups system administrator/programmer and manages our next-generation sequencing (ngs) datasets.

Personal:
I'm passionate about designing, implementing and optimizing
(almost) the complete stack of bleeding-edge/web2.0 applications, using open source and open processes.
Going from lowlevel (hardware), through OS and software/services
running on top of it, all the way to the actual application in all its
aspects. (minus user interfaces).
...as required by scalability and performance constraints.  The more
pressure there is on the application and its infrastructure the more I
like it.
I like optimizing things.  I look at the big picture, but I can focus
on specific areas.  
This is a pretty broad spectrum where all of the words ""engineer"", ""operations"", and even ""developer"" are in place.
Often it's hard to distinguish, and often there is no need to.

I have experience with high-scale (1000+servers) web2.0 environments 
See http://www.linkedin.com/in/dieterplaetinck

I like to work in a team of likeminded people who are as eager to learn as me.
Preferrably, in a company past the early bootstrapping phase so that at
least some structure and procedures have been laid out.   I'm interested in defining and optimizing procedures and workflows as well.  I cannot function properly without at least decent communication.

I'm OK with relocating.
